# Python OOPS Assignment – Course Catalog & Employee Management

1 Defined a base class `Course` with attributes: course code, name, and credit hours   
2 Created two subclasses:  
  `CoreCourse` – adds a boolean `required_for_major`  
  `ElectiveCourse` – adds a string `elective_type` (e.g., technical, general)  
3 Developed an `Employee` class with attributes `name`, `salary` and methods `get_name()` & `get_salary()`
